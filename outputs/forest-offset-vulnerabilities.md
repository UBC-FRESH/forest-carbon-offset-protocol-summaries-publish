# Forest Carbon Offset Protocol Vulnerability Review

This document highlights where each protocol may be susceptible to misuse or
unintended outcomes, organised by the same KPI framework used for the workshop
summaries. The points flag areas that facilitators can use to spark critical
discussion; they are not exhaustive audits.

## Governance & Protocol Setting

### B.C. FCOP (2024)
- Provincial government acts as both regulator and registry owner; limited
  transparency on how enforcement resourcing scales with project volume.
- Heavy reliance on Project Proponent assertions (e.g., First Nations engagement
  attestation) without systematic public disclosure of consultation records.

### Verra VCS (v4.7)
- Methodology approval pipeline can result in “method shopping”, where
  proponents select lenient legacy methodologies during grace periods.
- Delegated validation/verification bodies create potential conflict-of-interest
  incentives, especially where developers self-select auditors repeatedly.

### Gold Standard (v2.1 suite)
- Multi-program governance (GSVERs, labels, SDG tools) elevates complexity;
  limited oversight on how stakeholder engagement findings influence final
  certification decisions.
- Smaller project developers may struggle to interpret layered requirements,
  leading to reliance on consultants who may optimise for certificate issuance
  rather than rigour.

### Climate Action Reserve FPP (v5.1)
- Reserve board approves projects but also promotes programme adoption,
  creating reputational incentives to keep pipeline approvals moving quickly.
- Professional Forester requirement emphasises technical competence but does
  not prevent foresters from being hired to maximise credits for clients.

## Baseline & Additionality Rules

### B.C. FCOP (2024)
- Project-specific baseline pathway allows proponents to craft bespoke scenarios
  using internal modelling; reviewers must detect overly aggressive assumptions.
- Financial additionality relies on assertions that offset revenue is required,
  yet limited transparency on cash flow models makes validation difficult.

### Verra VCS (v4.7)
- Activity-method “positive lists” deem projects additional without project-level
  investment analysis, opening door for mature technologies in favourable
  jurisdictions to claim credits.
- Grace periods when methodologies are updated enable proponents to rush
  projects under older, more permissive baseline rules (“baseline hacking”).

### Gold Standard (v2.1 suite)
- Suppressed-demand baselines for small-scale projects can materially inflate
  results if not grounded in robust national data.
- Financial additionality tools mirror CDM-era tests that have known loopholes,
  such as sensitivity to hurdle rate assumptions controlled by the developer.

### Climate Action Reserve FPP (v5.1)
- Standardised baseline relies on peer group carbon averages; landowners with
  historically conservative harvesting get rewarded even if no change occurs.
- Avoided conversion projects can assume counterfactual deforestation based on
  appraisals that may overstate development pressure.

## Monitoring, Reporting, Verification (MRV)

### B.C. FCOP (2024)
- Monitoring intervals up to five years mean disturbances or management changes
  can go unreported for lengthy periods.
- ISO-aligned monitoring plans are only reviewed at validation and revalidation,
  creating gaps for procedural drift.

### Verra VCS (v4.7)
- Materiality threshold (5 %) allows accumulation of small estimation biases
  across multiple pools without triggering corrective action.
- Desk-based verifications permitted between site visits reduce likelihood of
  discovering field-level discrepancies.

### Gold Standard (v2.1 suite)
- Projects self-select monitoring indicators for SDG impacts, enabling focus on
  easily achieved metrics while ignoring harder-to-measure externalities.
- Remote sensing accuracy requirement (>=90 %) lacks independent auditing;
  developers may cherry-pick scenes favourable to project claims.

### Climate Action Reserve FPP (v5.1)
- Annual monitoring data remain internal until verification; missed reporting
  deadlines can reset obligations rather than trigger penalties.
- Buffer risk ratings reviewed only during site visits; projects can delay updates
  if they avoid verification cycles.

## Credit Issuance & Registries

### B.C. FCOP (2024)
- Director discretion to withhold issuance is rarely exercised publicly,
  signalling low risk of sanction for aggressive claims.
- Contingency account contributions fixed by risk tool even if project adds
  insurance, potentially underfunding coverage when new threats emerge.

### Verra VCS (v4.7)
- Verra Registry allows label stacking (e.g., CCB) but does not prevent double
  marketing of the same credits across voluntary compliance claims.
- Buffer pool is pooled globally; catastrophic regional events could strain its
  ability to cover reversals, yet no dynamic pricing is in place.

### Gold Standard (v2.1 suite)
- Planned Emission Reductions (PERs) monetise future sequestration ex-ante;
  market incentives favour optimistic forecasts.
- Impact Registry authorisations for Article 6 rely on host country reporting,
  which may lag or conflict with domestic inventory data.

### Climate Action Reserve FPP (v5.1)
- CRT issuance continues after project transfer until new owner completes
  paperwork, inviting gaps where reporting responsibilities are unclear.
- Buffer pool contributions are static percentages; climate change driven
  disturbance trends may render historical risk tables obsolete.

## Eligible Activities & Credit Use

### B.C. FCOP (2024)
- Limited project types reduce diversification; proponents may stretch
  definitions (e.g., CONS/IFM vs AFF/REF) to access favourable rules.

### Verra VCS (v4.7)
- Broad global eligibility plus numerous methodologies invite mismatched
  baselines when applying standards across socio-ecological contexts.
- Exclusion list for grid-connected renewables in non-LDCs can be circumvented
  via nested programmes or host country designations.

### Gold Standard (v2.1 suite)
- Positive list updates lag emerging practices, meaning older methodologies may
  still allow contentious activities (e.g., plantation forestry) if framed as
  sustainable development.

### Climate Action Reserve FPP (v5.1)
- Requirement to include all forested acres owned within HUC boundary can be
  gamed by transferring marginal tracts to affiliated entities prior to project start.

## Safeguards & Co-benefits

### B.C. FCOP (2024)
- First Nations engagement requirement depends on project-led reporting; there
  is no central register to confirm communities agree with statements made.

### Verra VCS (v4.7)
- Stakeholder consultation records often limited to developer-produced minutes,
  making it hard for outsiders to assess consent quality.

### Gold Standard (v2.1 suite)
- Extensive safeguard lists can become box-ticking exercises; verifiers may
  accept qualitative narratives without independent corroboration.

### Climate Action Reserve FPP (v5.1)
- Natural forest management rules focus on structural metrics but do not require
  biodiversity monitoring beyond deadwood and age class distributions.

## Permanence & Reversal Management

### B.C. FCOP (2024)
- Regional risk defaults (18/27/37 %) may lag evolving disturbance regimes,
  leaving contingency accounts undercapitalised.
- 100-year monitoring obligation relies on project viability long after crediting
  ends; enforcement mechanisms post-crediting remain unclear.

### Verra VCS (v4.7)
- Projects can lower risk ratings with documentation of mitigation measures
  that may be aspirational (e.g., fire plans) without verification of execution.
- Buffer pool withdrawals for unavoidable reversals are opaque to outsiders,
  complicating independent assessment of solvency.

### Gold Standard (v2.1 suite)
- PER issuance prior to verified sequestration exposes buyers to reversal risk;
  buffer contributions (20 %) may be insufficient if projects default before
  conversion to GSVERs.

### Climate Action Reserve FPP (v5.1)
- Requiring reversals to be reported within six months assumes rapid detection;
  slow-moving pests or diseases could go unnoticed.
- Avoidable reversal penalties rely on surrendering CRTs; financially distressed
  operators might default instead of compensating.

## Materiality & Data Quality

### B.C. FCOP (2024)
- 5 % annual materiality threshold allows cumulative misstatement over 25-year
  crediting periods before triggering intervention.

### Verra VCS (v4.7)
- Uncertainty deductions often calculated using project-supplied statistics,
  with limited replication by auditors.

### Gold Standard (v2.1 suite)
- Many SDG indicators lack quantitative baselines, allowing projects to claim
  qualitative improvements without third-party verification.

### Climate Action Reserve FPP (v5.1)
- Inventory confidence deductions derived from project sampling; foresters paid
  by project owner may select stratifications yielding favourable error bounds.

## Leakage

### B.C. FCOP (2024)
- Optional project-specific leakage adjustments can use developer-commissioned
  studies to justify lower deductions.

### Verra VCS (v4.7)
- IFM leakage factors depend on developer-declared displacement analysis; data
  often proprietary and difficult for verifiers to challenge.

### Gold Standard (v2.1 suite)
- Leakage categories captured in first-year deductions only; subsequent market
  shifts are not reassessed, risking underestimation.

### Climate Action Reserve FPP (v5.1)
- Leakage decision tree binary choices mask nuanced supply-chain shifts; 0.2
  market factor may be too low for certain timber markets.

## Notable Cross-Cutting Issues

- Reliance on self-reported data is common across all standards; independent
  public registries rarely expose raw monitoring datasets.
- Buffer pools and contingency accounts are backward-looking; climate risk is
  escalating faster than adjustment mechanisms.
- Methodology grace periods create windows for “standard shopping”, rewarding
  developers who time submissions to lock in favourable rules.
