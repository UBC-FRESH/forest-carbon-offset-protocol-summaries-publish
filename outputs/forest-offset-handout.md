# B.C. Forest Carbon Offset Protocol (FCOP) — Summary

*Reference shorthand: “BC FCOP §X” denotes sections of the 2024 Forest
Carbon Offset Protocol (Version 2, April 18 2024).*

## 1. Snapshot

- Issued by the Director under Section 10 of the Greenhouse Gas
  Industrial Reporting and Control Act; Version 2 effective 18
  April 2024. *(BC FCOP cover; §1.0)*
- Applies to forest carbon projects in British Columbia that meet the
  Emission Offset Project Regulation (EOPR) and protocol rules. *(BC
  FCOP §1.0)*
- Eligible project types: Afforestation/Reforestation (AFF/REF),
  Conservation & Improved Forest Management (CONS/IFM), Avoided
  Conversion (AC). *(BC FCOP §3.3)*

## 2. Governance & Protocol Setting

- Legally binding requirements for project proponents, validation
  bodies, and verification bodies; protocol supplements EOPR and must be
  read alongside it. *(BC FCOP §1.0)*
- Director accepts project plans, issues offset units, and may withhold
  issuances if reporting obligations are outstanding. *(BC FCOP §3.4,
  §3.7, §8.4.3)*
- Project proponents must comply with other provincial statutes (e.g.,
  Forests Act, Professional Governance Act) and maintain records per
  EOPR. *(BC FCOP §1.0)*
- Indigenous engagement is mandatory: proponents must notify, meet,
  share information with, and report back to Applicable First Nations;
  ongoing engagement throughout the crediting period is expected. *(BC
  FCOP §3.1.6)*

## 3. Baseline & Additionality Rules

- Baseline determination uses two pathways:
  - Performance Standard (mandatory for AFF/REF on public land): choose
    regulatory, historic practice, or hybrid scenario, selecting the
    most conservative option. *(BC FCOP §5.1)*
  - Project-Specific (default for other cases): identify all plausible
    scenarios, evaluate 20-year historic data, assess
    financial/legal/technical obstacles, and evidence candidate
    viability. *(BC FCOP §5.2)*
- Additionality assertions cover both financial need (revenues from
  offsets required to proceed) and regulatory additionality (activities
  exceed existing or new requirements); reconfirmed in each project
  report. *(BC FCOP §3.1, §6.1–§6.2)*
- Project reductions cannot be claimed in other offset systems and
  cannot receive per-tonne incentive funding. *(BC FCOP §3.1, §6.2)*

## 4. Monitoring, Reporting, Verification (MRV)

- Project plan must include an ISO 14064-2–aligned Monitoring &
  Maintenance Plan detailing data collection and risk management across
  crediting and monitoring periods. *(BC FCOP §3.1.1, §8.4.1, §10.0)*
- Project reports span 12 months to 5 years, reported on a calendar-year
  basis; Director may withhold issuance if reports are late. *(BC FCOP
  §3.7)*
- Monitoring period extends 100 years after the crediting period;
  monitoring reports due in four 25-year blocks within six months after
  each block. *(BC FCOP §3.5, §10.1)*
- Validation and verification bodies operate under EOPR accreditation;
  proponents must maintain data retention schedules to support audits.
  *(BC FCOP §1.0, §10.0)*

## 5. Credit Issuance & Registries

- Default crediting period is 25 years from project start (shorter
  optional), with potential revalidation at expiry; monitoring
  obligations run 100 years beyond crediting. *(BC FCOP §3.5)*
- Start date cannot precede the date proponents obtained rights to
  submit the plan and claim offsets; Director rejects plans older than
  one year from protocol notice (or \>5 years after activity start).
  *(BC FCOP §3.4)*
- Contingency Account functions as a buffer: contributions and remedial
  payments calculated via defined equations when reversals occur. *(BC
  FCOP §8.4.3; Equations 35 & 39)*

## 6. Eligible Activities & Credit Use

- Projects must occur in B.C. and document entitlements on land tenure
  (public, private, First Nations, treaty settlement, Aboriginal title).
  *(BC FCOP §3.1–§3.2)*
- Per-tonne grant or subsidy funding is incompatible; offsets must not
  be issued elsewhere. *(BC FCOP §3.1)*
- Agreements with First Nations or provincial commitments can influence
  start dates but must still meet entitlement and reporting rules. *(BC
  FCOP §3.4)*

## 7. Safeguards & Co-benefits

- Required First Nations engagement steps (notice, meetings,
  incorporation of input, ongoing dialogue) serve as the primary social
  safeguard mechanism. *(BC FCOP §3.1.6)*
- Projects on First Nations or Treaty Settlement land need formal
  evidence of support (e.g., Band Council Resolution, Certificates of
  Possession). *(BC FCOP §3.2.3)*
- Protocol references compliance with other environmental/social
  statutes but does not mandate broader co-benefit certification
  frameworks. *(BC FCOP §1.0)*

## 8. Permanence & Reversal Management

- Monitoring & Maintenance Plan must address risk categories (fire,
  pests, financial, etc.) and identify mitigation and reporting
  commitments backed by recent evidence. *(BC FCOP §8.4.1)*
- Reversal events occur when project emissions exceed baseline;
  proponents must quantify impacts and report impairment. *(BC FCOP
  §8.4.2; Equation 33)*
- Default natural-disturbance risk contributions to the contingency
  account are 18% (Coast), 27% (Northern Interior), and 37% (Southern
  Interior) before project-specific deductions; financial/management
  risk factors are added separately. *(BC FCOP Table 23; Table 25;
  Equations 39–41)*

## 9. Materiality Thresholds & Data Quality

- Materiality threshold set at ±5% of annual emissions/removals; applies
  to errors, omissions, and misrepresentation. *(BC FCOP §3.6)*
- Project plans must justify calculation methodologies for each
  sink/source/reservoir and ensure data quality through inventories
  (e.g., VRI) and sampling protocols. *(BC FCOP §3.1, §10.0)*

## 10. Leakage Assessment & Mitigation

- Addresses activity leakage and external market leakage; provides
  default regional leakage factors (e.g., Coast ~47%, Northern Interior
  ~72%, Southern Interior ~69%) with option for project-specific
  analysis via Appendix C. *(BC FCOP §8.3; Tables 10–18)*
- Baseline assessments for avoided conversion must consider regional
  development trends and evidentiary requirements (permits, offers,
  economic analysis). *(BC FCOP §5.2.1)*
- Guidance encourages adjusting leakage estimates when species mix
  deviates from provincial averages. *(BC FCOP §8.3.2.3)*

## 11. Recent Updates & Discussion Prompts

- 2024 revision introduced contingency account and risk-of-reversal
  framework, updated leakage defaults, required Monitoring & Maintenance
  Plans, and formalized First Nations engagement. *(BC FCOP Summary of
  Revisions)*
- Workshop prompts: How does the 25-year crediting/100-year monitoring
  structure influence perceptions of permanence? Is the 5% materiality
  threshold sufficient for high-variance forest data? Do engagement
  requirements meet expectations for robust social safeguards?

# Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) — Summary

*Reference shorthand: “VCS Standard §X” denotes clauses in the VCS
Standard v4.7 (16 Apr 2024); “Program Guide §X” references the VCS
Program Guide v4.4 (29 Aug 2023); “Reg/Issuance §Step Y” references the
Registration & Issuance Process v4.6 (16 Oct 2024); “NPRT §X” references
the AFOLU Non-Permanence Risk Tool v4.2 (3 May 2024).*

## 1. Snapshot

- Global program administered by Verra covering the seven Kyoto gases
  plus ODS; eligible projects apply VCS-approved or adopted
  methodologies within defined scope exclusions. *(VCS Standard §2.1)*
- AFOLU project categories include ARR, ALM, IFM, REDD, ACoGS, and WRC;
  non-AFOLU activities span energy, industrial, waste, and other sectors
  subject to scope limitations in non-LDC contexts. *(VCS Standard
  Appendix 1; §2.1.3)*
- Core document suite: VCS Standard, Program Guide (governance,
  registry), Registration & Issuance Process (project cycle), and
  supporting tools (e.g., AFOLU NPRT). *(Program Guide Contents;
  Reg/Issuance §Step 1–7)*

## 2. Governance & Protocol Setting

- Verra (independent non-profit) manages the program, maintains
  impartiality, oversees VVBs, and administers the Verra Registry.
  *(Program Guide §2.5.4–2.5.6)*
- Roles: project proponents control implementation and documentation;
  methodology developers follow the Methodology Development & Review
  Process; accredited VVBs validate/verify within approved sector
  scopes. *(Program Guide §2.5.1–2.5.3; §7.1–7.3)*
- Registry operations include account management, buffer credit
  tracking, fee collection, and liability provisions; complaints/appeals
  are codified. *(Program Guide §4.0–4.2; §9)*
- Registration & issuance follow a seven-step workflow from validation
  through periodic issuance, retirement/cancellation, and ongoing
  maintenance reviews. *(Reg/Issuance §Step 1–7)*

## 3. Baseline & Additionality Rules

- Baselines must follow applied methodology requirements, demonstrate
  equivalence of services, use conservative assumptions, and integrate
  applicable regulations or policies. *(VCS Standard §3.13.1–3.13.4)*
- Additionality requires regulatory surplus at validation and each
  crediting period renewal; methodologies or approved activity modules
  (positive lists) provide tests, with safeguards when simplified
  approaches originate from other programs. *(VCS Standard
  §3.14.1–3.14.2)*
- Project start/validation timing governed by listing, public comment,
  and deadline rules; AFOLU crediting periods span 20–100 years
  (renewable up to 100 years total) with reassessment of
  baseline/regulatory conditions at renewal. *(VCS Standard §3.8;
  §3.9.3–3.9.9)*

## 4. Monitoring, Reporting, Verification (MRV)

- Projects must maintain a GHG information system, QA/QC procedures,
  calibrated measurement equipment, and monitor leakage per methodology.
  *(VCS Standard §3.16.1–3.16.5; §3.15.15)*
- Verification requires reasonable assurance with materiality thresholds
  of 5 % (1 % for large projects), mandated site visits at validation,
  first verification, baseline reassessment, and major deviations; VVBs
  evaluate responses to public comments prior to issuing conclusions.
  *(VCS Standard §4.1.10–4.1.14; §3.18.13)*
- Monitoring reports follow Verra templates and feed into periodic
  verification; VVBs apply ISO 14065 competence requirements and
  document rationale when site visits are deferred. *(VCS Standard
  §4.1.19; Reg/Issuance §Step 1)*

## 5. Credit Issuance & Registries

- VCUs are issued only after successful verification and Verra
  registration review; Verra deposits calculated buffer credits to
  pooled accounts before credit issuance. *(VCS Standard §2.3.1;
  §3.15.16; Reg/Issuance §Step 3–5)*
- Project proponents sign unilateral representations, and registry terms
  of use prohibit double selling; registry tracks serial numbers,
  retirements, cancellations, and pooled buffer balances. *(Program
  Guide §2.5.1; §4.0; VCS Standard §3.23.1–3.23.6)*
- Fees and liability/time limits are defined in Program Guide; VCUs
  retain permanence even if projects later experience reversals (buffer
  credits cover losses). *(Program Guide §4.1–4.2; VCS Standard §2.4.1)*

## 6. Eligible Activities & Credit Use

- Scope excludes certain grid-connected renewable and fossil energy
  efficiency activities in non-LDCs unless specific conditions are met;
  AFOLU activities must align with Appendix 1 definitions. *(VCS
  Standard §2.1.3; Appendix 1)*
- Projects cannot receive credit simultaneously under VCS and another
  GHG program; detailed gap validation requirements apply for
  transitions from programs such as CAR, CDM, or JI. *(VCS Standard
  §3.23.1–3.23.13)*
- VCUs can carry labels (e.g., CCB, SD VISta) to communicate
  co-certifications; Program Guide outlines registry processes for such
  labels and associated fees. *(VCS Standard §3.24; Program Guide §4.1)*

## 7. Safeguards & Co-benefits

- Projects must demonstrate contributions to at least three SDGs by the
  end of first monitoring period and each subsequent period; CCB or SD
  VISta verifications can satisfy this requirement. *(VCS Standard
  §3.17.1–3.17.2)*
- Stakeholder engagement requires inclusive identification,
  pre-implementation consultation covering risks, benefit sharing, FPIC,
  and workers’ rights, with documentation of actions taken in response.
  *(VCS Standard §3.18.1–3.18.3)*
- Grievance redress involves staged resolution (negotiation → mediation
  → arbitration/courts) and ongoing communication obligations before
  each validation/verification. *(VCS Standard §3.18.4–3.18.6)*
- Extensive safeguards address community safety, labor rights (including
  gender equity, equal pay, prohibition of forced/child labor),
  indigenous/customary rights, cultural heritage, property rights,
  benefit sharing, biodiversity protection, and limits on ecosystem
  conversion. *(VCS Standard §3.19.1–3.19.29)*

## 8. Permanence & Reversal Management

- AFOLU projects must run the AFOLU NPRT to determine non-permanence
  risk; internal, external, and natural risk scores are summed, with
  minimum overall rating 12 and maximum 60. *(NPRT §2.5.1–2.5.3)*
- The overall risk percentage equals the fraction of carbon stock
  increase deposited as buffer credits; category thresholds (internal
  \<=35, external \<=20, natural \<=35) ensure risk diversification, and
  projects exceeding limits must mitigate risks before eligibility.
  *(NPRT §2.5.2–2.5.4)*
- Verra periodically reconciles pooled buffer accounts and can adjust
  risk criteria prospectively; buffer cancellations compensate for
  verified reversals so issued VCUs remain intact. *(VCS Standard
  §2.4.1–2.4.3; §3.15.16)*

## 9. Materiality Thresholds & Data Quality

- Verifications apply 5 % (1 %) aggregate materiality thresholds; VVBs
  must log rationale when site visits are waived, evaluate stakeholder
  input, and ensure methodology deviations do not undermine
  conservativeness. *(VCS Standard §4.1.10–4.1.16; §3.20)*
- Monitoring plans require QA/QC procedures, calibrated instruments,
  documented data sources, and justification of any optional leakage
  deductions or methodology updates. *(VCS Standard §3.16.1–3.16.5;
  §3.15.8–3.15.15)*
- Double-entry safeguards include project description deviation
  protocols and documentation of ownership, reducing risk of data misuse
  or double claiming. *(VCS Standard §3.7; §3.21; §3.23)*

## 10. Leakage Assessment & Mitigation

- Leakage must be documented in project design and monitoring; IFM
  activities can apply default market leakage discounts (0–70 %)
  depending on harvest displacement, with optional 15 %
  activity-shifting and 10 % market deductions under defined conditions.
  *(VCS Standard §3.15.8–3.15.15; Table 3)*
- International leakage (outside host country) need not be quantified,
  but projects cannot claim positive leakage; Verra reviews market
  leakage assessments periodically for consistency. *(VCS Standard
  §3.15.11–3.15.14; §2.5.1)*

## 11. Recent Updates & Discussion Prompts

- v4.7 updates consolidate expanded safeguard language (FPIC, gender,
  biodiversity), clarify acceptable use of non-native species where
  consistency with safeguards is demonstrated, and align AFOLU
  risk/leakage oversight with the latest NPRT. *(VCS Standard Document
  History notes §4364–4400)*
- Discussion starters: How do long AFOLU crediting periods and buffer
  contributions shape perceived permanence risk relative to other
  protocols? What implementation burden does the SDG contribution
  requirement create for projects targeting compliance vs voluntary
  buyers? How do VCS leakage discounts compare with jurisdictional
  approaches (e.g., CAR or BC FCOP) when groups design “good” versus
  “bad” protocols?

LUF Smallholder Definition.*

## 1. Snapshot

- Certification governed by Principles & Requirements; project cycle
  includes Gold Standard Certified Project Design and Gold Standard
  Certified Project, with optional product labels (Principles §2.1–2.3).
- Land-use eligibility guided by LUF Activity Requirements, Positive
  List of approved practices, and smallholder definitions; A/R
  methodology provides quantification rules for carbon sequestration
  projects (LUF §1–§4; Positive List; Smallholder).
- Impact Registry records issuance/retirement of Gold Standard Verified
  Emission Reductions (GSVERs), Planned Emission Reductions (PERs), and
  Article 6 authorisations (GHG PR §§10–15).

## 2. Governance & Protocol Setting

- Gold Standard Foundation oversees certification, maintains the Impact
  Registry, and approves dual/stacked certification to avoid double
  counting (Principles §3.1.1; GHG PR §§10.1.2, 10.7).
- Eligibility requires defined project boundaries, legal compliance,
  uncontested ownership, host-country law adherence, and transparency on
  Official Development Assistance (Principles §3.1.1(a–h)).
- LUF projects submit detailed GIS layers, socio-economic context, and
  risk assessment covering land-use history, stakeholder profiles, and
  project change risks (LUF §4.1.3; §4.1.2 bullets).
- Impact Registry terms govern account access, serial tracking, and
  Article 6 authorisations; false or duplicate claims can trigger
  suspension (GHG PR §§10–14).

## 3. Baseline & Additionality Rules

- Projects define conservative baseline and project scenarios
  considering legal enforcement; suppressed demand baselines limited to
  eligible small-scale contexts (Principles §4.1.8–4.1.10).
- Projects must document contributions to at least three SDGs (including
  SDG 13) and identify monitoring indicators at design stage (Principles
  §4.1.12–4.1.16).
- Financial additionality is required for product issuance: apply
  UNFCCC/GS additionality tools (CDM Tool 01/21, etc.), demonstrate
  regulatory surplus, and show carbon finance necessity (Principles
  §§4.1.46–4.1.48; Methodology §3.2.2–3.2.3).
- LUF requirements emphasise baseline land-use assessment, modelling
  unit definition, and eligibility verification (LUF §4.1; Methodology
  §§2.1–3.5).

## 4. Monitoring, Reporting, Verification (MRV)

- Monitoring plan (validated at design) must specify parameters,
  frequency, data collection methods, responsible parties, QA/QC, and
  ethical considerations (Principles §§4.1.40–4.1.45).
- A/R methodology quantifies sequestration by modelling units, deducting
  baseline and leakage upfront (t=1) and tracking annual CO2 removals;
  remote sensing classification must reach \>=90 % accuracy (Methodology
  §§3.3–3.7; Annex C §1.1.6).
- GHG Product Requirements set default crediting periods (max 10 years
  absent activity-specific rules), retroactive crediting limits (2
  years, or 3 years for A/R/AGR), and require verification before Impact
  Registry issuance (GHG PR §§10.1–10.4).
- Performance Certification cross-checks monitored carbon stocks vs
  issued PERs/GSVERs; deviations trigger reporting within 30 days and
  corrective actions (GHG PR §11.4.1).

## 5. Credit Issuance & Registries

- GSVERs issued post-verification; PERs (ex-ante) allowed for LUF
  projects up to 5 years (3 years for agriculture) with 20 % buffer
  withholding and conversion to GSVERs after verification (GHG PR
  §§11.1–11.2).
- Impact Registry manages serials, authorisations, and claims; dual
  certification permitted only with explicit Gold Standard approval to
  prevent double crediting (Principles §2.3; GHG PR §10.1.2).
- Projects operating under other programs must ensure combined crediting
  periods do not exceed Gold Standard limits; pre-CDM GSVER issuance
  requires surrender commitments (GHG PR §§10.1.2, 10.7.1).

## 6. Eligible Activities & Credit Use

- Project types must align with approved Activity Requirements or secure
  approval; fossil fuel, nuclear, and geo-engineering projects are
  excluded (Principles §4.1.7).
- Positive List enumerates eligible A/R practices (e.g., assisted
  natural regeneration, agroforestry); smallholder definition (\<25 ha
  or \<25 % income from agriculture) unlocks tailored requirements and
  default factors (Positive List; Smallholder §2).
- Stacking (combining products) is permitted under defined conditions,
  provided baselines and impacts are compatible and double counting is
  avoided (Principles §2.3; §4.1.11).

## 7. Safeguards & Co-benefits

- Safeguarding framework covers human rights, gender equality, labour
  safety, biodiversity, pollution, cultural heritage,
  indigenous/customary rights, and conflict sensitivity; projects must
  assess risks, document mitigation, and provide supporting evidence
  (Safeguards §§4–5; Annex).
- Gender requirements mandate gender-responsive assessments, equal
  participation, and reporting on gender indicators linked to selected
  SDGs (Gender §§2.1–2.4).
- Stakeholder consultation entails at least two formal meetings (Local
  Stakeholder Consultation I & II), public comment periods, and
  documentation of responses; continuous input & grievance mechanism
  must remain active through the crediting period (Stakeholder
  §§3.1–3.8; LUF Annex D).
- FPIC is required where land/resource rights are affected; stakeholder
  lists, contact records, and updates are included in each monitoring
  report (Stakeholder §§3.5–3.8; Principles §3.1.1(f)).

## 8. Permanence & Reversal Management

- LUF projects contribute 20 % of sequestration-related PERs/GSVERs to
  the Compliance Buffer; contribution not required for purely avoidance
  projects (GHG PR §11.1.1).
- Carbon Performance provisions require tracking actual stocks vs issued
  credits, reporting incidents within 30 days, and following Performance
  Shortfall Guidelines when shortfalls occur (GHG PR §11.4.1).
- LUF requirements enforce riparian buffer zones (15 m), mosaic
  planting, conservation set-asides, and documentation of land-use
  history to mitigate reversal risks (LUF §§4.1, 7.2, Annexes).

## 9. Materiality & Data Quality

- Monitoring plan mandates QA/QC and ethical data handling; SDG
  indicators tie to national/international datasets or justified proxy
  metrics (Principles §§4.1.15–4.1.16; §4.1.40).
- Remote sensing classifications for eligibility require \>=90 %
  accuracy and documentation of sensors, methods, and ground-truthing
  (Methodology Annex C §1.1.4–1.1.7).
- Impact Registry oversight and Terms of Use enforce accurate reporting;
  breaches can suspend account access and de-label credits (GHG PR
  §§13–14).

## 10. Leakage Assessment & Mitigation

- A/R methodology addresses leakage via four activity categories
  (fuelwood, timber, agriculture, livestock) with deductions applied in
  year 1 using activity-shift percentages and CO2-stock estimates
  (Methodology §§3.7.1–3.7.8).
- LUF requirements integrate socio-economic assessments, land-use
  planning, and buffer/mosaic design to minimise displacement risks (LUF
  §§4.1.2, 7.2, 12).

## 11. Recent Updates & Discussion Prompts

- 2024/2025 updates reinforce SDG alignment, financial additionality,
  expanded safeguarding, and Article 6 reporting; GHG Product
  Requirements v3.0 formalise 20 % buffer and Impact Registry
  authorisation workflows.
- Workshop prompts: How does Gold Standard’s dual requirement for SDG
  impacts and financial additionality influence project credibility?
  Compare the 20 % compliance buffer and carbon performance checks with
  VCS/CAR permanence mechanisms. Evaluate stakeholder consultation depth
  relative to other standards when crafting “good” vs “bad” protocols.

# Climate Action Reserve – U.S. Forest Project Protocol Summary

*Reference shorthand: “FPP §X” denotes clauses in the U.S. Forest
Protocol v5.1 (2023‑07‑20); “Appendix” references the same document;
companion documents include Quantification Guidance (2017‑06‑28),
Long-Term Management (2019‑06), and aggregation/summary notes.*

## 1. Snapshot

- U.S.-focused protocol covering Improved Forest Management (IFM),
  Reforestation, and Avoided Conversion; projects generate Climate
  Reserve Tonnes (CRTs) after third-party verification and Reserve
  review.
- Credit permanence enforced via 100-year monitoring and verification
  obligations post-final issuance; Buffer Pool insures against
  unavoidable reversals.
- Protocol underpins California’s compliance offset program and
  voluntary market CRTs; eligible projects may transition from Climate
  Forward or other programs following Reserve Program Manual procedures.

## 2. Governance & Eligibility

- **Project Operator & Ownership:** Project Operator must document
  carbon rights, ownership interests, and professional forester
  oversight (FPP §2.2; §8.1).
- **Eligible Lands:** IFM/Reforestation allowed on private, tribal, and
  subnational public lands; Avoided Conversion restricted to private
  lands unless transferred to public ownership with 100-year
  conservation easement (FPP §2.1; §3.2.3).
- **Project Area Definition:** IFM projects must include all forested
  acres controlled by the owner within the smallest applicable HUC12/14
  watershed or full ownership; exceptions require Reserve approval (FPP
  §4.2).
- **Start Date & Listing:** Linked to discrete action (e.g., easement
  recordation, property transfer, project submittal) and projects must
  be listed within 12 months of start date (FPP §3.2).
- **Additionality Tests:** Legal Requirement Test, Performance Standard
  (standardized baselines), and long-term commitment (100-year) ensure
  surplus reductions (FPP §3.3).
- **Natural Forest Management:** Projects must meet native species, age
  distribution, structural element, and harvest retention criteria;
  progress checked at initial and subsequent verifications (FPP
  §3.9.1–§3.9.3; Table 3.3).

## 3. Baseline & Quantification

- **Baseline Stocks:** Derived from Assessment Area Data Files (peer
  group carbon averages) adjusted for legal constraints; must reflect
  business-as-usual management over 100 years (FPP §6.3; Appendix C).
- **Annual Net Reductions:** Equation 6.1 aggregates changes in onsite
  carbon (DeltaAConsite – DeltaBConsite), soil carbon (if applicable),
  harvested wood products (80 % factor for market response), secondary
  effects (leakage), and carry-over (FPP §6.1).
- **Leakage:** Activity-shifting leakage percentage determined via
  decision tree (Figure 6.1); applied annually to net onsite change for
  cropland/grazing displacement. Market leakage factor (0.2) embedded in
  harvested wood product term for IFM (FPP §6.2.6; Equation 6.3).
- **Confidence Deduction:** Statistical uncertainty deduction applied to
  inventory estimates per Appendix B; baseline re-assessed only if
  methodology changes approved by Reserve.

## 4. Monitoring, Reporting, Verification (MRV)

- **Reporting Periods:** Initial period up to 12 months; subsequent
  annual periods must be contiguous. Monitoring reports due within 12
  months of each period end even if verification deferred (FPP
  §8.2–§8.3).
- **Verification Schedule:** Initial verification within 12 months of
  first reporting period; site visits required at least every six
  reporting periods (approx. six years) with desk reviews allowed
  between required visits under specified conditions (\<4,000 CRTs/year
  issuance). Monitoring and verification continue 100 years post-final
  issuance (FPP §8.3.2; Table 8.1).
- **Documentation:** Project Design Document, calculation worksheets,
  attestations, verification statements, and Professional Forester
  oversight required; KML/GIS files must match project area maps (FPP
  §8.1; §4.2).

## 5. Credit Issuance & Registries

- **CRTs:** Issued after Reserve review of third-party verification
  report and compliance attestations; project enters Project
  Implementation Agreement (PIA) committing to long-term obligations
  (FPP §8.1).
- **Buffer Pool:** Project-specific reversal risk rating (Appendix A)
  determines percentage of CRTs contributed each issuance. Qualified
  conservation easements/deed restrictions can reduce risk rating;
  contributions adjusted if risk changes (FPP §7.2).
- **Reversals:** If annual net reductions (QRy) negative post-issuance,
  Reserve deems reversal. Unavoidable reversals (e.g., wildfire)
  compensated by Buffer Pool retirements; avoidable reversals require
  project to surrender CRTs within four months of verified estimate (FPP
  §7.3).
- **Termination:** Failure to report/verify as required or project area
  withdrawal triggers automatic termination and avoidable reversal
  treatment (FPP §3.5; §4.3).

## 6. Eligible Activities & Credit Use

- **Project Types:** IFM (sustainable harvest, stocking, structural
  upgrades), Reforestation (tree planting/regeneration on non-forest
  lands), Avoided Conversion (prevent conversion to non-forest use with
  100-year easement). Aggregated projects follow additional guidance
  (Aggregation Guidelines 2017).
- **Stacking:** Allowed with prior Reserve approval to prevent double
  counting; project documentation must ensure baseline/additionality
  maintained (FPP §2.1).
- **Program Linkages:** Projects may transition to/from CARB Compliance
  Offset Program or Climate Forward; must follow Reserve Program Manual
  and meet respective buffer/verification rules (FPP §3.2; Long-Term
  Management note).

## 7. Safeguards & Co-benefits

- **Natural Forest Management:** Ensures native species composition,
  structural diversity, dead wood retention, watershed-scale age class
  balance, riparian protection, and soil disturbance limits (FPP §3.9;
  Table 3.2–3.3).
- **Harvest Controls:** Even-aged block size limits tied to residual
  basal area; re-entry restrictions until regeneration established (FPP
  §3.9.2).
- **Public Land Projects:** Require agency approval and public vetting
  consistent with management responsibilities; conservation easements
  mandate 100-year forest cover (FPP §2.1; §3.2).
- **Social Safeguards:** No explicit SDG framework; safeguards embedded
  in easement commitments, public approvals, and long-term monitoring
  requirements.

## 8. Permanence & Reversal Management

- **100-Year Obligation:** Project operators must maintain credited
  carbon stocks and conduct monitoring/verification for 100 years after
  final CRT issuance (FPP §7.1; §8.2).
- **Buffer Pool Contributions:** Risk-based (typically ~15–20 % per
  Reserve guidance); contributions withheld each issuance and may be
  adjusted if risk profile changes. Alternative insurance instruments
  may be allowed in future (FPP §7.2.2–7.2.3).
- **Natural Disturbance Response:** Projects must report unavoidable
  reversals within six months, submit verified inventory within two
  years (or when mortality stabilizes), and allow Reserve to retire
  Buffer Pool CRTs (FPP §7.3.1).
- **Avoidable Reversals:** Report within 30 days, verify within one
  year, and surrender CRTs; includes planned harvest exceeding baseline
  or misestimation (FPP §7.3.2).

## 9. Materiality & Data Quality

- **Inventory Standards:** Professional/Certified Forester oversight
  required; inventory methods documented in PDD and updates per Appendix
  B (FPP §8.1).
- **GIS & Parcel Reconciliation:** Acreage discrepancies resolved using
  lesser of GIS or assessor data or by working with assessor; KML
  shapefiles mandatory (FPP §4.2).
- **Verification Manual:** Reserve Verification Program Manual outlines
  sampling, error thresholds, corrective action, and dispute processes
  complementing protocol requirements (FPP §10).

## 10. Leakage Assessment & Mitigation

- **Activity-Shifting Leakage:** Decision tree assigns percentage (based
  on timber market, grazing/cropland displacement risk); applied
  annually to net onsite carbon changes (FPP Figure 6.1; Equation 6.3).
- **Market Leakage:** 0.2 factor embedded in harvested wood product term
  to account for market response where project harvest differs from
  baseline (FPP §6.2.6).
- **Quantification Guidance:** Companion document provides step-by-step
  inventory, growth model, and leakage calculations to ensure consistent
  application.

## 11. Recent Updates & Discussion Prompts

- Version 5.1 clarifies natural forest management timelines,
  verification schedules, and easement provisions; maintains risk-based
  buffer approach aligned with CARB program.
- Discussion prompts: Compare CAR’s standardized baseline and Buffer
  Pool with VCS and Gold Standard approaches; debate practicality of
  100-year monitoring requirement when designing “good” vs “bad”
  protocols; evaluate leakage treatment (decision tree + 0.2 market
  factor) relative to BC FCOP’s regional defaults and VCS optional
  deductions.

## Discussion Themes (initial)

- Permanence strategies: compare contingency account (BC), pooled
  buffers (VCS, CAR), compliance buffer + PERs (Gold Standard).
- Stakeholder and social safeguards: First Nations focus vs global SDG
  requirements vs natural forest management criteria.
- Treatment of leakage: regional defaults vs decision trees vs optional
  deductions.
- Credit issuance pacing: PERs and CRTs with long-term monitoring vs
  VCUs; workshop could explore “good” vs “bad” design choices using
  buffer/leakage levers.
