# Workshop Context

This handout supports the UBC Sustainability Hub event [Negotiation
Innovation: Advancing Climate Action through Research and
Learning](https://sustain.ubc.ca/events/negotiation-innovation-advancing-climate-action-through-research-and-learning).
It introduces four prominent forest carbon offset standards to spark
critical, non-partisan discussion among participants who may be new to
the topic.

## How to Engage with the Summaries

- Treat every section as a starting point for questions rather than
  definitive conclusions.
- Compare how each standard addresses the four design elements
  (measurement protocols, certificates, carbon reduction confidence,
  non-carbon metrics) and identify vulnerabilities.
- Cross-reference the companion vulnerabilities briefing for prompts on
  design trade-offs.

*Status*: DRAFT for workshop circulation. Updates will follow as peer
review feedback is incorporated.

# B.C. Forest Carbon Offset Protocol (FCOP) — Summary

*Reference shorthand: “BC FCOP §X” denotes sections of the 2024 Forest
Carbon Offset Protocol (Version 2, April 18 2024).*

## 1. Snapshot

- Issued by the Director under Section 10 of the Greenhouse Gas
  Industrial Reporting and Control Act; Version 2 effective 18
  April 2024. *(BC FCOP cover; §1.0)*
- Applies to forest carbon projects in British Columbia that meet the
  Emission Offset Project Regulation (EOPR) and protocol rules. *(BC
  FCOP §1.0)*
- Eligible project types: Afforestation/Reforestation (AFF/REF),
  Conservation & Improved Forest Management (CONS/IFM), Avoided
  Conversion (AC). *(BC FCOP §3.3)*

## 2. Carbon Accounting Protocols

- Legally binding requirements for project proponents, validation
  bodies, and verification bodies; protocol supplements EOPR and must be
  read alongside it. *(BC FCOP §1.0)*
- Director accepts project plans, issues offset units, and may withhold
  issuances if reporting obligations are outstanding. *(BC FCOP §3.4,
  §3.7, §8.4.3)*
- Project proponents must comply with other provincial statutes (e.g.,
  Forests Act, Professional Governance Act) and maintain records per
  EOPR. *(BC FCOP §1.0)*
- Indigenous engagement is mandatory: proponents must notify, meet,
  share information with, and report back to Applicable First Nations;
  ongoing engagement throughout the crediting period is expected. *(BC
  FCOP §3.1.6)*
- Baseline determination uses two pathways:
  - Performance Standard (mandatory for AFF/REF on public land): choose
    regulatory, historic practice, or hybrid scenario, selecting the
    most conservative option. *(BC FCOP §5.1)*
  - Project-Specific (default for other cases): identify all plausible
    scenarios, evaluate 20-year historic data, assess
    financial/legal/technical obstacles, and evidence candidate
    viability. *(BC FCOP §5.2)*
- Additionality assertions cover both financial need (revenues from
  offsets required to proceed) and regulatory additionality (activities
  exceed existing or new requirements); reconfirmed in each project
  report. *(BC FCOP §3.1, §6.1–§6.2)*
- Project reductions cannot be claimed in other offset systems and
  cannot receive per-tonne incentive funding. *(BC FCOP §3.1, §6.2)*

## 3. Certificates

- Default crediting period is 25 years from project start (shorter
  optional), with potential revalidation at expiry; monitoring
  obligations run 100 years beyond crediting. *(BC FCOP §3.5)*
- Start date cannot precede the date proponents obtained rights to
  submit the plan and claim offsets; Director rejects plans older than
  one year from protocol notice (or \>5 years after activity start).
  *(BC FCOP §3.4)*
- Contingency Account functions as a buffer: contributions and remedial
  payments calculated via defined equations when reversals occur. *(BC
  FCOP §8.4.3; Equations 35 & 39)*
- Projects must occur in B.C. and document entitlements on land tenure
  (public, private, First Nations, treaty settlement, Aboriginal title).
  *(BC FCOP §3.1–§3.2)*
- Per-tonne grant or subsidy funding is incompatible; offsets must not
  be issued elsewhere. *(BC FCOP §3.1)*
- Agreements with First Nations or provincial commitments can influence
  start dates but must still meet entitlement and reporting rules. *(BC
  FCOP §3.4)*

## 4. Carbon Reduction Confidence

- Project plan must include an ISO 14064-2–aligned Monitoring &
  Maintenance Plan detailing data collection and risk management across
  crediting and monitoring periods. *(BC FCOP §3.1.1, §8.4.1, §10.0)*
- Project reports span 12 months to 5 years, reported on a calendar-year
  basis; Director may withhold issuance if reports are late. *(BC FCOP
  §3.7)*
- Monitoring period extends 100 years after the crediting period;
  monitoring reports due in four 25-year blocks within six months after
  each block. *(BC FCOP §3.5, §10.1)*
- Validation and verification bodies operate under EOPR accreditation;
  proponents must maintain data retention schedules to support audits.
  *(BC FCOP §1.0, §10.0)*
- Monitoring & Maintenance Plan must address risk categories (fire,
  pests, financial, etc.) and identify mitigation and reporting
  commitments backed by recent evidence. *(BC FCOP §8.4.1)*
- Reversal events occur when project emissions exceed baseline;
  proponents must quantify impacts and report impairment. *(BC FCOP
  §8.4.2; Equation 33)*
- Default natural-disturbance risk contributions to the contingency
  account are 18% (Coast), 27% (Northern Interior), and 37% (Southern
  Interior) before project-specific deductions; financial/management
  risk factors are added separately. *(BC FCOP Table 23; Table 25;
  Equations 39–41)*
- Materiality threshold set at ±5% of annual emissions/removals; applies
  to errors, omissions, and misrepresentation. *(BC FCOP §3.6)*
- Project plans must justify calculation methodologies for each
  sink/source/reservoir and ensure data quality through inventories
  (e.g., VRI) and sampling protocols. *(BC FCOP §3.1, §10.0)*
- Addresses activity leakage and external market leakage; provides
  default regional leakage factors (e.g., Coast ~47%, Northern Interior
  ~72%, Southern Interior ~69%) with option for project-specific
  analysis via Appendix C. *(BC FCOP §8.3; Tables 10–18)*
- Baseline assessments for avoided conversion must consider regional
  development trends and evidentiary requirements (permits, offers,
  economic analysis). *(BC FCOP §5.2.1)*
- Guidance encourages adjusting leakage estimates when species mix
  deviates from provincial averages. *(BC FCOP §8.3.2.3)*

## 5. Non-Carbon Metrics

- Required First Nations engagement steps (notice, meetings,
  incorporation of input, ongoing dialogue) serve as the primary social
  safeguard mechanism. *(BC FCOP §3.1.6)*
- Projects on First Nations or Treaty Settlement land need formal
  evidence of support (e.g., Band Council Resolution, Certificates of
  Possession). *(BC FCOP §3.2.3)*
- Protocol references compliance with other environmental/social
  statutes but does not mandate broader co-benefit certification
  frameworks. *(BC FCOP §1.0)*

## 6. Recent Updates & Discussion Prompts

- 2024 revision introduced contingency account and risk-of-reversal
  framework, updated leakage defaults, required Monitoring & Maintenance
  Plans, and formalized First Nations engagement. *(BC FCOP Summary of
  Revisions)*
- Workshop prompts: How does the 25-year crediting/100-year monitoring
  structure influence perceptions of permanence? Is the 5% materiality
  threshold sufficient for high-variance forest data? Do engagement
  requirements meet expectations for robust social safeguards?

# Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) — Summary

*Reference shorthand: “VCS Standard §X” denotes clauses in the VCS
Standard v4.7 (16 Apr 2024); “Program Guide §X” references the VCS
Program Guide v4.4 (29 Aug 2023); “Reg/Issuance §Step Y” references the
Registration & Issuance Process v4.6 (16 Oct 2024); “NPRT §X” references
the AFOLU Non-Permanence Risk Tool v4.2 (3 May 2024).*

## 1. Snapshot

- Global program administered by Verra covering the seven Kyoto gases
  plus ODS; eligible projects apply VCS-approved or adopted
  methodologies within defined scope exclusions. *(VCS Standard §2.1)*
- AFOLU project categories include ARR, ALM, IFM, REDD, ACoGS, and WRC;
  non-AFOLU activities span energy, industrial, waste, and other sectors
  subject to scope limitations in non-LDC contexts. *(VCS Standard
  Appendix 1; §2.1.3)*
- Core document suite: VCS Standard, Program Guide (governance,
  registry), Registration & Issuance Process (project cycle), and
  supporting tools (e.g., AFOLU NPRT). *(Program Guide Contents;
  Reg/Issuance §Step 1–7)*

## 2. Carbon Accounting Protocols

- Verra (independent non-profit) manages the program, maintains
  impartiality, oversees VVBs, and administers the Verra Registry.
  *(Program Guide §2.5.4–§2.5.6)*
- Roles: project proponents control implementation and documentation;
  methodology developers follow the Methodology Development & Review
  Process; accredited VVBs validate/verify within approved sector
  scopes. *(Program Guide §2.5.1–§2.5.3; §7.1–§7.3)*
- Registry operations include account management, buffer credit
  tracking, fee collection, and liability provisions; complaints/appeals
  are codified. *(Program Guide §4.0–§4.2; §9)*
- Registration & issuance follow a seven-step workflow from validation
  through periodic issuance, retirement/cancellation, and ongoing
  maintenance reviews. *(Reg/Issuance §Step 1–7)*
- Baselines must follow applied methodology requirements, demonstrate
  equivalence of services, use conservative assumptions, and integrate
  applicable regulations or policies. *(VCS Standard §3.13.1–§3.13.4)*
- Additionality requires regulatory surplus at validation and each
  crediting period renewal; methodologies or approved activity modules
  (positive lists) provide tests, with safeguards when simplified
  approaches originate from other programs. *(VCS Standard
  §3.14.1–§3.14.2)*
- Project start/validation timing governed by listing, public comment,
  and deadline rules; AFOLU crediting periods span 20–100 years
  (renewable up to 100 years total) with reassessment of
  baseline/regulatory conditions at renewal. *(VCS Standard §3.8;
  §3.9.3–§3.9.9)*

## 3. Certificates

- VCUs are issued only after successful verification and Verra
  registration review; Verra deposits calculated buffer credits to
  pooled accounts before credit issuance. *(VCS Standard §2.3.1;
  §3.15.16; Reg/Issuance §Step 3–5)*
- Project proponents sign unilateral representations, and registry terms
  of use prohibit double selling; registry tracks serial numbers,
  retirements, cancellations, and pooled buffer balances. *(Program
  Guide §2.5.1; §4.0; VCS Standard §3.23.1–§3.23.6)*
- Fees and liability/time limits are defined in Program Guide; VCUs
  retain permanence even if projects later experience reversals (buffer
  credits cover losses). *(Program Guide §4.1–§4.2; VCS Standard
  §2.4.1)*
- Scope excludes certain grid-connected renewable and fossil energy
  efficiency activities in non-LDCs unless specific conditions are met;
  AFOLU activities must align with Appendix 1 definitions. *(VCS
  Standard §2.1.3; Appendix 1)*
- Projects cannot receive credit simultaneously under VCS and another
  GHG program; detailed gap validation requirements apply for
  transitions from programs such as CAR, CDM, or JI. *(VCS Standard
  §3.23.1–§3.23.13)*
- VCUs can carry labels (e.g., CCB, SD VISta) to communicate
  co-certifications; Program Guide outlines registry processes and fees.
  *(VCS Standard §3.24; Program Guide §4.1)*

## 4. Carbon Reduction Confidence

- Projects must maintain a GHG information system, QA/QC procedures,
  calibrated measurement equipment, and monitor leakage per methodology.
  *(VCS Standard §3.16.1–§3.16.5; §3.15.15)*
- Verification requires reasonable assurance with materiality thresholds
  of 5 % (1 % for large projects), mandated site visits at validation,
  first verification, baseline reassessment, and major deviations; VVBs
  evaluate responses to public comments prior to issuing conclusions.
  *(VCS Standard §4.1.10–§4.1.14; §3.18.13)*
- Monitoring reports follow Verra templates and feed into periodic
  verification; VVBs apply ISO 14065 competence requirements and
  document rationale when site visits are deferred. *(VCS Standard
  §4.1.19; Reg/Issuance §Step 1)*
- AFOLU projects must run the AFOLU NPRT to determine non-permanence
  risk; internal, external, and natural risk scores are summed, with
  minimum overall rating 12 and maximum 60. *(NPRT §2.5.1–§2.5.3)*
- The overall risk percentage equals the fraction of carbon stock
  increase deposited as buffer credits; category thresholds (internal
  \<=35, external \<=20, natural \<=35) ensure risk diversification, and
  projects exceeding limits must mitigate risks before eligibility.
  *(NPRT §2.5.2–§2.5.4)*
- Verra periodically reconciles pooled buffer accounts and can adjust
  risk criteria prospectively; buffer cancellations compensate for
  verified reversals so issued VCUs remain intact. *(VCS Standard
  §2.4.1–§2.4.3; §3.15.16)*
- Verifications apply 5 % (1 %) aggregate materiality thresholds; VVBs
  must log rationale when site visits are waived, evaluate stakeholder
  input, and ensure methodology deviations do not undermine
  conservativeness. *(VCS Standard §4.1.10–§4.1.16; §3.20)*
- Monitoring plans require QA/QC procedures, calibrated instruments,
  documented data sources, and justification of any optional leakage
  deductions or methodology updates. *(VCS Standard §3.16.1–§3.16.5;
  §3.15.8–§3.15.15)*
- Leakage must be documented in project design and monitoring; IFM
  activities can apply default market leakage discounts (0–70 %)
  depending on harvest displacement, with optional 15 %
  activity-shifting and 10 % market deductions under defined conditions.
  *(VCS Standard §3.15.8–§3.15.15; Table 3)*
- International leakage (outside host country) need not be quantified,
  but projects cannot claim positive leakage; Verra reviews leakage
  assessments periodically for consistency. *(VCS Standard
  §3.15.11–§3.15.14; §2.5.1)*

## 5. Non-Carbon Metrics

- Projects must demonstrate contributions to at least three SDGs by the
  end of first monitoring period and each subsequent period; CCB or SD
  VISta verifications can satisfy this requirement. *(VCS Standard
  §3.17.1–§3.17.2)*
- Stakeholder engagement requires inclusive identification,
  pre-implementation consultation covering risks, benefit sharing, FPIC,
  and workers’ rights, with documentation of actions taken in response.
  *(VCS Standard §3.18.1–§3.18.3)*
- Grievance redress involves staged resolution (negotiation → mediation
  → arbitration/courts) and ongoing communication obligations before
  each validation/verification. *(VCS Standard §3.18.4–§3.18.6)*
- Extensive safeguards address community safety, labor rights (including
  gender equity, equal pay, prohibition of forced/child labor),
  indigenous/customary rights, cultural heritage, property rights,
  benefit sharing, biodiversity protection, and limits on ecosystem
  conversion. *(VCS Standard §3.19.1–§3.19.29)*

## 6. Recent Updates & Discussion Prompts

- v4.7 updates consolidate expanded safeguard language (FPIC, gender,
  biodiversity), clarify acceptable use of non-native species where
  consistency with safeguards is demonstrated, and align AFOLU
  risk/leakage oversight with the latest NPRT. *(VCS Standard Document
  History notes §4364–4400)*
- Discussion starters: How do long AFOLU crediting periods and buffer
  contributions shape perceived permanence risk relative to other
  protocols? What implementation burden does the SDG contribution
  requirement create for projects targeting compliance vs voluntary
  buyers? How do VCS leakage discounts compare with jurisdictional
  approaches (e.g., CAR or BC FCOP) when groups design “good” versus
  “bad” protocols?

- Positive List enumerates eligible activities; smallholder definitions
  unlock tailored rules; stacking allowed under compatibility checks.
  *(Positive List; Smallholder §2; Principles §2.3)*

## 4. Carbon Reduction Confidence

- Monitoring plans validated at design must specify parameters,
  frequency, responsible parties, ethics, and QA/QC approaches; annual
  monitoring reports underpin verifications. *(Principles
  §4.1.40–§4.1.45; GHG PR §10.3)*
- A/R methodology quantifies sequestration by modelling units, deducting
  baseline and leakage upfront (t=1) and tracking annual CO2 removals;
  remote sensing classification must reach \>=90 % accuracy.
  *(Methodology §§3.3–§3.7; Annex C §1.1.6)*
- Compliance buffer requires 20 % of sequestration components; carbon
  performance checks compare stocks vs issued PERs/GSVERs and define
  remedial actions. *(GHG PR §§11.1, 11.4)*
- PER issuance prior to verification, soil carbon optional modules, and
  buffer safeguards manage permanence risk; reversals handled via
  Performance Shortfall Guidelines. *(GHG PR §§11.1–11.4)*
- Materiality, uncertainty, and QA guidance captured in Methodology/GHG
  PR; projects must justify default factors, sampling, and inventory
  accuracy. *(Methodology §§3.5–3.7; Annex C; GHG PR §10)*
- Leakage deductions applied in year 1 for activity categories
  (fuelwood, timber, agriculture, livestock) with optional default
  factors; compliance buffer addresses residual risk. *(Methodology
  §3.7; GHG PR §§10.1–10.4)*

## 5. Non-Carbon Metrics

- Safeguarding framework covers human rights, gender equality, labour
  conditions, biodiversity, pollution, cultural heritage,
  indigenous/customary rights, and conflict sensitivity; projects must
  assess risks, document mitigation, and provide evidence. *(Safeguards
  §§4–5)*
- Gender requirements mandate gender-responsive assessments, equal
  participation, and reporting on gender indicators linked to selected
  SDGs. *(Gender §§2.1–2.4)*
- Stakeholder consultation follows two formal rounds plus continuous
  grievance mechanism; FPIC required where rights may be affected.
  *(Stakeholder §§3.1–3.8)*

  Impact tools and certified safeguards. *(GHG PR §§10–11; GS SDG
  tools)*

## 6. Recent Updates & Discussion Prompts

- 2024/2025 updates reinforce SDG alignment, financial additionality,
  expanded safeguarding, and Article 6 reporting; GHG Product
  Requirements v3.0 formalise 20 % buffer and Impact Registry
  authorisation workflows.
- Workshop prompts: How does Gold Standard’s dual requirement for SDG
  impacts and financial additionality influence project credibility? Do
  suppressed-demand baselines risk over-crediting? What governance
  challenges arise from multi-program certification (GSVERs + labels)?

# Climate Action Reserve – U.S. Forest Project Protocol Summary

*Reference shorthand: “FPP §X” denotes clauses in the U.S. Forest
Protocol v5.1 (2023‑07‑20); “Appendix” references the same document;
companion documents include Quantification Guidance (2017‑06‑28),
Long-Term Management (2019‑06), and aggregation/summary notes.*

## 1. Snapshot

- U.S.-focused protocol covering Improved Forest Management (IFM),
  Reforestation, and Avoided Conversion; projects generate Climate
  Reserve Tonnes (CRTs) after third-party verification and Reserve
  review.
- Credit permanence enforced via 100-year monitoring and verification
  obligations post-final issuance; Buffer Pool insures against
  unavoidable reversals.
- Protocol underpins California’s compliance offset program and
  voluntary market CRTs; eligible projects may transition from Climate
  Forward or other programs following Reserve Program Manual procedures.

## 2. Carbon Accounting Protocols

- Climate Action Reserve administers the U.S. Forest Protocol; Project
  Implementation Agreement binds operators; Professional Forester
  oversight required. *(FPP §2.1; §8.1)*
- Eligible lands: IFM/Reforestation (private, tribal, and subnational
  public), Avoided Conversion (private with 100-year easement). Projects
  must include all forested acres owned within HUC12/14 unless approved
  otherwise. *(FPP §2.1; §4.2)*
- Project start date linked to discrete action (easement recordation,
  property transfer, project submittal) and listing must occur within 12
  months. *(FPP §3.2)*
- Baseline uses standardized assessment area data with adjustments for
  legal constraints; project-specific justifications required for any
  deviations. *(FPP §6.3; Appendix C)*
- Additionality assured via Legal Requirement Test, performance
  standard, and 100-year commitment; natural forest management criteria
  govern native species, structure, and harvest practices. *(FPP §3.3;
  §3.9)*

## 3. Certificates

- CRTs issued after Reserve review of third-party verification and
  compliance attestations; Project Implementation Agreement sets
  obligations. *(FPP §8.1; §9)*
- Buffer Pool contributions determined by project-specific risk rating
  (Appendix A); qualified conservation easements or deed restrictions
  can reduce contributions. *(FPP §7.2)*
- Projects cannot receive credit simultaneously under other programs;
  gap validation and start-date rules manage transitions. *(Program
  Manual §3.23 analog)*
- Aggregated projects follow additional guidance; long-term management
  note outlines obligations beyond crediting. *(Aggregation Guidelines;
  Long-Term Management note)*

## 4. Carbon Reduction Confidence

- Annual monitoring with professional forester oversight; monitoring
  reports due within 12 months of each reporting period, even if
  verification deferred. *(FPP §8.2–§8.3)*
- Verification schedule requires initial verification within 12 months
  and site visits at least every six reporting periods (around six
  years); failure triggers suspension/termination. *(FPP §8.3.2; Table
  8.1)*
- Baseline/on-site carbon updates use approved inventory methodologies,
  wood product accounting, and confidence deductions; negative annual
  totals trigger reversal procedures. *(FPP §6.1; §7.1)*
- Buffer pool and reversal provisions distinguish avoidable vs
  unavoidable events, detailing notification, quantification, and
  compensation timelines. *(FPP §7.2–§7.3)*
- Materiality managed via inventory confidence deductions, GIS acreage
  reconciliation, and professional standards. *(FPP §4.2; Appendix B)*
- Leakage addressed via decision tree assigning percentage deductions
  and 0.2 market factor for wood products; activity-shifting leakage
  assessed annually. *(FPP §6.2.6; Figure 6.1; Equation 6.3)*

## 5. Non-Carbon Metrics

- Natural Forest Management ensures native species composition,
  structural diversity, deadwood retention, and watershed-scale age
  balance. *(FPP §3.9.2; Table 3.3)*
- Sustainable harvesting guidelines limit block size relative to
  retention; conservation easements/public approvals required for public
  land projects. *(FPP §3.9.1; §2.1)*
- Social safeguards rely on easement commitments, public agency approval
  processes, and long-term monitoring obligations.

## 6. Recent Updates & Discussion Prompts

- Version 5.1 clarifies natural forest management timelines,
  verification schedules, and easement provisions while maintaining
  risk-based buffer approach aligned with CARB program.

- Discussion prompts: How do standardized baselines interact with
  diverse landowner histories? Does buffer pooling sufficiently account
  for climate-driven disturbance trends? What trade-offs arise from
  mandatory HUC-based project area inclusion?

- Version 5.1 clarifies natural forest management timelines,
  verification schedules, and easement provisions; maintains risk-based
  buffer approach aligned with CARB program.

- Discussion prompts: Compare CAR’s standardized baseline and Buffer
  Pool with VCS and Gold Standard approaches; debate practicality of
  100-year monitoring requirement when designing “good” vs “bad”
  protocols; evaluate leakage treatment (decision tree + 0.2 market
  factor) relative to BC FCOP’s regional defaults and VCS optional
  deductions.

| **Carbon Accounting Protocols**          | Provincial protocol under GGIRCA; Director accepts plans, issues units, and mandates First Nations engagement; baseline options include performance standard and project-specific pathways with 20-year records. | Verra manages global standard, methodology approval, and registry; baselines/additionality governed by methodology requirements with positive lists and regulatory surplus test; AFOLU crediting up to 100 years. | Principles & Requirements define governance, eligibility, and SDG commitments; LUF Activity Requirements and methodologies set baseline and additionality, including suppressed demand allowances.         | Reserve administers U.S. Forest Protocol; standardized baselines by assessment area with legal requirement test; inclusion of all forested acres owned within HUC12/14; natural forest management criteria apply.                                   |
| **Certificates**                         | 25-year crediting (extendable), 100-year monitoring; contingency account contributions; projects must document tenure rights; offsets cannot be double counted.                                                  | VCUs issued post-verification via Verra Registry; pooled buffer contributions; exclusions for certain renewables; projects can carry labels; terms prohibit double selling.                                       | GSVERs issued after verification; PERs (ex-ante) convert later with 20% compliance buffer; Impact Registry handles labels and Article 6 authorisations; positive list governs eligible activities.         | CRTs issued after Reserve review; buffer pool contributions risk-based; gap validation handles transitions; aggregation/long-term management guidelines support issuance.                                                                           |
| **Carbon Reduction Confidence**          | ISO 14064-2 monitoring plan, reports every 1–5 years, 100-year monitoring tail; reversal management via contingency account; 5% materiality; regional leakage factors with adjustments.                          | MRV requires QA/QC, calibrated equipment, site visits; AFOLU Non-Permanence Risk Tool sets buffer percentage; 5%/1% materiality; leakage deductions (0–70%) plus activity-shifting options.                       | Monitoring plans specify indicators/QA; A/R methodology handles modelling/leakage; 20% buffer and carbon performance checks manage reversals; PER issuance and SDG indicators require careful validation.  | Annual monitoring with professional forester oversight; verification schedule (site visits every six years or less); buffer pool distinguishes avoidable/unavoidable reversals; confidence deductions and leakage decision tree manage uncertainty. |
| **Non-Carbon Metrics**                   | Mandatory First Nations engagement; projects on Indigenous lands require formal agreements; limited broader co-benefit frameworks.                                                                               | Projects must contribute to at least three SDGs; stakeholder engagement, FPIC, grievance mechanisms, and extensive safeguards covering community, labour, biodiversity.                                           | Comprehensive safeguards (human rights, gender, labour, biodiversity); gender equality requirements; two-stage consultation plus continuous grievance mechanism; potential price premiums for co-benefits. | Natural forest management maintains native species, structural diversity, deadwood; public land projects require agency approval; safeguards embedded in easement commitments.                                                                      |
| **Notable Updates / Discussion Prompts** | 2024 revision added contingency account, risk-of-reversal tool, updated leakage defaults, and formalized First Nations engagement; consider permanence/materiality implications.                                 | v4.7 expanded safeguards and SDG requirements; updated AFOLU risk/leakage oversight; prompts on permanence, SDG burden, leakage comparisons.                                                                      | 2024/25 updates reinforce SDG alignment, financial additionality, 20% buffer, Article 6 reporting; discuss PER + buffer design, suppressed-demand baselines, multi-program governance.                     | v5.1 clarified natural forest management timelines, verification schedules, easement provisions; evaluate standardized baseline impacts, buffer adequacy under climate change, HUC inclusion trade-offs.                                            |

## Discussion Themes (initial)

- Permanence strategies: compare contingency account (BC), pooled
  buffers (VCS, CAR), compliance buffer + PERs (Gold Standard).
- Stakeholder and social safeguards: First Nations focus vs global SDG
  requirements vs natural forest management criteria.
- Treatment of leakage: regional defaults vs decision trees vs optional
  deductions.
- Credit issuance pacing: PERs and CRTs with long-term monitoring vs
  VCUs; workshop could explore “good” vs “bad” design choices using
  buffer/leakage levers.
